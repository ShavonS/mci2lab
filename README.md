# Game Description
This is an interactive bubble popping game with a unique black hole power-up feature. The objective is to pop as many bubbles as possible while avoiding missing too many. The game gets progressively harder as you score more points.

## How to Play
1. **Pop Bubbles**: Click on the bubbles to pop them and earn points.
2. **Avoid Missing**: Don't let too many bubbles escape the screen. You can miss up to 3 bubbles.
3. **Black Hole Power-Up**: Activate the black hole power-up by pressing the 'B' key. The black hole can only be activated once every 90 seconds and will clear all bubbles on the screen.
4. **Two-Finger Interaction**: Use a two-finger pinch gesture to activate the black hole power-up. The black hole will be activated if the distance between your fingers changes significantly.
5. **Level Up**: Your level increases as you score more points, making the game more challenging.

## Controls
